# a little object oriented casino simulation
first of all need to say that this project is not supposed to has real casino games or sth like that,
it has a fictitious game and a simple procedure for betting 

## the game
every time that game starts a random number would be selected from 1 to 36 and every players has multiple options to bet on:
* select a single number
* select a range of numbers
* select whether the number would be odd or even 
Obviously there is an inverse relationship between the probability of winning and the percentage of profit or loss.
